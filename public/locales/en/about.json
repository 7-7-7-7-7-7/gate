  "about_me_one": "Hello! My name is Rodolfo, I'm 26 years old and I live in Santiago, Chile. I am currently involved in multiple areas of IT, such as software development and cloud infrastructure management. My interest is focused on those topics mainly, in which I use the latest technologies offered by the market. My mission as a professional is to be a constant contribution and provide quality to the projects in which I participate. I am aware that in this profession everything is constantly changing, and that is why I like to be constantly learning.",
  "about_me_two": " I consider that I am a person who likes new challenges. Since I was a child I had contact with the world of electronics, having been born in the era where technology was in full growth. I learned to program when I was 16 years old out of curiosity and a couple of years later I decided to study and make this my profession, so I entered to study the career of Programmer Analyst at INACAP, from which I graduated in 2019.",
  "about_me_three": " Personally, I consider that traditional university education does not motivate me as much as learning new things in a self-taught way, and different topics (not only computer science). Other subjects I am passionate about are drawing, painting, sci-fi TV series, reading about science and technology, languages, gastronomy and photography. I also really enjoy music and its different genres. I am not a big sports person, but I do swimming in the mornings during the week. I have been vegetarian for almost four years now and I am working on going vegan soon. I feel that little by little we are moving forward as humanity towards a world free of animal cruelty.",
