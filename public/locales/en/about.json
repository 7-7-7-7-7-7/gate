  "about_me_one": "Hello! My name is Rodolfo, I'm 26 years old and I live in Santiago, Chile. My professional background is focused on IT, mainly working in areas such as software development and cloud infrastructure management. Usually I try to use the latest technologies offered by the market, and my mission as a professional is to be a constant contribution and provide quality to the projects in which I participate. I am aware that in this profession everything is constantly changing, that's why I like to be constantly learning.",
  "about_me_two": "I consider that I am a person who likes new challenges. Since I was a child I had contact with the world of electronics, having been born in the era where technology was in full growth. I learned to program at the age of 16 out of curiosity and a couple of years later I decided to study and make this my profession.",
  "about_me_three": "Personally, I find that traditional university education doesn't motivate me as much as learning new things in a self-taught way, and about different topics (not only computer science). Other subjects I am passionate about are drawing, painting, science fiction TV series, reading about science and technology, languages, gastronomy and photography. I also really enjoy music and its different genres. I am not a big sports person, but I do free swimming in the mornings during the week. I have been vegetarian for almost four years now and I am working on going vegan soon. I feel that little by little we are moving forward as humanity towards a world free of animal cruelty."
